# Wallutils Wallpaper

![gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adi1090x/files/master/dynamic-wallpaper/main.gif)

This is just a collection of wallpapers that I have been using for like 2 years now which I shamelessly stole from [dynamic-wallpaper](https://github.com/adi1090x/dynamic-wallpaper) (seriously check his repo out! he got great wallpapers. THAT ARE MINE NOW >:D) by [adi1090x](https://github.com/adi1090x). Thanks for all the hardwork to him for compiling them alltogether and for the artists for making them!

I also shamelessly stole the gif above.

Well then what did I do? I made the `*.stw` files that makes it compatible with
working with [wallutils](https://github.com/xyproto/wallutils) and also the scripts that may make your life easier!
Adi's bash script hadn't work for me even after a lot of meddling around with
it for days. So I switched to a different tool! `wallutils`! It was the perfect
thing that I wanted.

Anyway so I guess you know the drill already but still I am letting instructions here for the needy:) ->

- Linux
- install [wallutils](https://github.com/xyproto/wallutils)
- run the `install_wallpapers.sh` script
- run the `set_random_wallpaper.sh` script

Tip: you can do `set_random_wallpaper.sh & disown` to make the script run in
background meaning you can close the terminal without losing the background :)

That is all folks! I put up this readme in about 10 mins because I wanted to
push my [niri-dots](https://github.com/AnkushRoy-code/niri-dots) ! so check them out too! And ‚≠ê star this repo if you liked
it! Also I apologize for halfassing this readme.

Lastly I want to state that I am not in any way affiliated to any of the
creators of any project or repos related to this repo if that wasn't obvious.
